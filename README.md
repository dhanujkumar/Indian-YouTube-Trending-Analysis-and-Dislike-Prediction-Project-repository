# Indian YouTube Trending Content Analysis and Dislike Prediction Project 


Welcome to the Indian YouTube Trending Content Analysis and Dislike Prediction Project repository! In this repository, we delve into the exciting world of Indian YouTube trends, empowering content creators with valuable insights to enhance their videos' engagement. Our comprehensive analysis pipeline covers missing value handling, preprocessing, and a powerful predictive model to estimate dislikes, aiding creators across various categories.


**What's Inside:**

 Here, I've embarked on an enriching journey into the realm of Indian YouTube trends, dedicated to enhancing content creators' abilities. This project spans a multitude of crucial stages, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Missing Values handling, Data Preprocessing, advanced Predictive Modeling, meticulous Fine-Tuning, and even a final act of Model Deployment.

**Highlights of the Project:**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I delved into the data adventure, unraveling the nuances of Indian YouTube trending videos. By dissecting the data, I've gained crucial insights into the heart of YouTube trends.

2. **Handling Missing Values:** I've donned the detective's hat to uncover missing pieces in our data puzzle. Employing clever techniques, I've ensured our analysis and predictions remain robust and insightful.

3. **Data Preprocessing:** My alchemy transforms raw, chaotic data into an organized masterpiece.  I've transformed categorical features into numbers so our model can understand them better. It's like teaching the model a new language!.'ve scaled numerical features to the same range, so they play well together. No one feature will overshadow the others now.
4. **Predictive Modeling:** Armed with cutting-edge machine learning, I've constructed a powerful predictive model. This Random Forest Regressor model harnesses the potential to foresee the number of dislikes a video may attract, a superpower for creators seeking audience engagement.

5. **Fine-Tuning the Magic:** Our journey doesn't end with a model. I've meticulously fine-tuned it to ensure its predictions are as accurate as possible, lending creators actionable insights.

6. **Model Deployment:** The grand finale! My hard work culminates in a model deployment, enabling creators to access predictions in a convenient and user-friendly manner.
