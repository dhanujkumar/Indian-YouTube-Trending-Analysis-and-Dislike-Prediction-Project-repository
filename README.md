**GitHub Repository: Indian YouTube Trending Analysis and Dislike Prediction**

Welcome to the Indian YouTube Trending Analysis and Dislike Prediction Project repository! In this repository, we delve into the exciting world of Indian YouTube trends, empowering content creators with valuable insights to enhance their videos' engagement. Our comprehensive analysis pipeline covers missing value handling, preprocessing, and a powerful predictive model to estimate dislikes, aiding creators across various categories.

**Key Features:**

1. **Dataset Exploration:** We've curated and meticulously cleaned a rich dataset of Indian YouTube trending videos. We examine its attributes to gain a deep understanding of the trends in the Indian YouTube landscape.

2. **Missing Value Handling:** We address missing data gracefully, employing robust techniques to ensure our analysis and model training are based on accurate information.

3. **Data Preprocessing:** Our preprocessing pipeline transforms raw data into a structured, ready-to-use format. This includes text normalization, feature extraction, and encoding categorical variables.

4. **Insightful Analysis:** We uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset, providing content creators with insights into what makes a video more likely to trend.

5. **Dislike Prediction Model:** The heart of our repository lies in a powerful predictive model. Using cutting-edge machine learning techniques, we've developed a model that can predict the number of dislikes a video is likely to receive. This prediction can serve as a valuable tool for creators to optimize their content and minimize negative engagement.

6. **Enhanced Decision Making:** Armed with our predictive model's output, content creators can fine-tune their videos to create engaging content that resonates positively with their audience.

7. **User-Friendly Notebooks:** Our user-friendly Jupyter notebooks guide you through the entire process, from data exploration to model deployment. We've included detailed comments and explanations to ensure easy understanding, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced data enthusiasts.

8. **Reproducibility and Customization:** The codebase and notebooks are designed to be easily reproducible, and you can tailor the model to your specific needs with ease.
